# Knitting Pattern Generator 

## General Info
This knitting pattern generator is a fullstack, one-week project. It was completed in accordance with the Denver Flatiron School's module 3 curriculum. The app takes inputs from a user about desired specifications of a knitted garment and generates a line-by-line pattern that the user may follow to create the customized garment. Users must create a profile and login to the app to be able to use the generator. Users may then save and edit patterns.

## Setup
This app requires the use of a Rails backend, the repository for which can be found [here](https://github.com/nolan-dyke/mod3_project_backend). Clone both this repository and the backend to your local machine. The backend comes equipped with all necessary gems, but the gems must be installed locally. This can be done by running:
`$ bundle install`
The backend should be served on port 4000, while the frontend may be served on any port. From here you may navigate the app.
